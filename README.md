Analysis Base Image Launcher
============================

This is a quick set of scripts to get AnalysisBase images working.

Quickstart
----------

 - Clone this repo (with the `--recursive` flag!)
 - Start docker
 - Run `./run.sh`

You might also want to configure a few things, see the ssh directory.
